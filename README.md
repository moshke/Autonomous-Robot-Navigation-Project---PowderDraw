# PowderDraw ‚Äì Autonomous Drawing Robot

## üìå Overview
PowderDraw is an autonomous mobile robot designed to draw large-scale patterns using colored powder. Developed as a final-year engineering project, it combines precise localization, real-time control, and sensor fusion to enable fully autonomous operation over open areas.

The robot utilizes the **Pixhawk** flight controller running **ArduPilot**, along with a **Raspberry Pi 4** for communication and control logic.
It integrates GPS, IMU, optical flow, and wheel encoders, using an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for accurate localization and navigation.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Design a low-cost, scalable robot for surface design using powder.
- Implement accurate autonomous navigation over a 30x30 meter field.
- Build a modular control architecture using open-source tools.
- Create a reliable powder-dispersion system controlled in real time.
